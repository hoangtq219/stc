Problem 2
=== 

Steve, who is lazy and an expert of petty tricks, is annoyed of having to memorize the passwords. He may carry a memo, but it may be exposed to others. So, he thought of an idea.
He will create a password with the remaining numbers after removing the pairs of same numbers from a number string consisting of numbers (~9. After removing the same number pairs, he can also remove the number pairs whose right and left numbers are the same. Following example shows the password from a number string after removing the applicable number pairs.

**Input**

The first line of the input file provides the length of the test case. The next line contains the number character string without a space. 
The character string consists of numbers between 0_9. The length of the character string N 10<N<100. The length of the password is smaller than the length of the character string.

**Output**

Each of 10 lines of the output file contains the answer (password) to each of 10 test cases. Each line begins with #x' followed by a space and then the answer. Here, x is the test case number.
